## Overview

This project consists of four main Python modules (`agent.py`, `email_handler_scr.py`, `prompts.py`, and `search.py`) designed to provide basic functionality for managing agents, handling emails, managing prompts, and performing searches. Each module encapsulates specific functionalities that can be used individually or integrated into a larger system.

## Modules

### `agent.py`

The `agent.py` module defines the `Agent` class, which represents an agent capable of sending and receiving emails, and searching for prompts.

#### Class: `Agent`

- **Attributes:**
  - `name` (str): The name of the agent.
  - `email` (str): The email address of the agent.

- **Methods:**
  - `send_email(subject, body)`: Simulates sending an email.
  - `receive_email()`: Simulates receiving an email.
  - `search_prompts(query)`: Simulates searching for prompts based on a query.

### `email_.py`

The `email_.py` module defines the `Email` class, which represents an email with basic functionalities to send and receive emails.

#### Class: `Email`

- **Attributes:**
  - `sender` (str): The sender's email address.
  - `recipient` (str): The recipient's email address.
  - `subject` (str): The subject of the email.
  - `body` (str): The body of the email.

- **Methods:**
  - `send()`: Simulates sending an email.
  - `receive()`: Simulates receiving an email.

### `prompts.py`

The `prompts.py` module defines the `Prompts` class, which manages a collection of prompts and provides functionalities to add, retrieve, and search prompts.

#### Class: `Prompts`

- **Attributes:**
  - `prompts` (list): A list to store prompts.

- **Methods:**
  - `add_prompt(prompt)`: Adds a new prompt to the collection.
  - `get_prompts()`: Retrieves all prompts.
  - `search_prompts(query)`: Searches for prompts that contain the query string.

### `search.py`

The `search.py` module defines the `Search` class, which performs search operations on a given data source.

#### Class: `Search`

- **Attributes:**
  - `data_source` (list): The data source to search within.

- **Methods:**
  - `search(query)`: Searches the data source for items containing the query string.

## Usage

To use these modules, import the relevant classes into your Python script and create instances of the classes. Below are some examples:

### Example: Using `Agent` Class

```python
from agent import Agent

agent = Agent(name="John Doe", email="john.doe@example.com")
agent.send_email(subject="Test Email", body="This is a test email.")
agent.receive_email()
agent.search_prompts(query="example")
Example: Using Email Class

from email_ import Email

email = Email(sender="john.doe@example.com", recipient="jane.doe@example.com", subject="Hello", body="Hi Jane!")
email.send()
email.receive()
Example: Using Prompts Class

from prompts import Prompts

prompts = Prompts()
prompts.add_prompt("What is your favorite color?")
print(prompts.get_prompts())
print(prompts.search_prompts(query="color"))
Example: Using Search Class


from search import Search

data_source = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]
search = Search(data_source)
results = search.search(query="an")
print(results)
